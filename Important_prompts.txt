Step 1 --> Read the goal_and_context_of_the_project.txt and structure_of_the_codebase.txt which are uploaded in the knowledge content 
Give me a brief summary of structure_of_the_codebase and a detailed summary of  goal_and_context_of_the_project to check if you understand the goal and the process of the project or not 

Step 2 --> read the 7 code files named 
test_config.py , test_data_loader.py , test_image_processor.py , test_mask_generator.py , test_model_manager.py , test_pconv.py ,test_weight_loader.py 
and also read the text file named output_of_seven_tests where the complete output of 7 tests is mentioned 
Give me a short 2 line summary of each code file and a brief summary of their output

Step 3 --> read the the files the above 7 files are used to test 
D:\Inpainting_tool2\config.yaml
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\data_loader.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\image_processor.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\mask_generator.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\weight_loader.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\core\model_manager.py

D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\models\pconv\vgg_extractor.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\models\pconv\loss.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\mask_generator.py

Give me a 2 line summary of the above files 

Step 4 --> Read the below files to understand the test_samples 
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\manage_test_data.py , 
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\organize_test_data.py , 
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\rename_test_files.py

Give me a 2 line summary of the above files 

Step 5 --> Read the below files to understand weights and its conversion 
 D:\Inpainting_tool2\scripts\weight_conversion\convert_weights.py 
 D:\Inpainting_tool2\scripts\weight_conversion\converter.py  
 D:\Inpainting_tool2\scripts\weight_conversion\verify_weights.py

Give me a 2 line summary of the above files 

Step 6 --> Read the below files to understand the web interface 
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\interface\app.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\interface\components\canvas_handler.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\interface\components\ui_components.py
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1 --> Read the goal_and_context_of_the_project.txt and structure_of_the_codebase.txt which are uploaded in the knowledge content 
Give me a brief summary of structure_of_the_codebase and a detailed summary of  goal_and_context_of_the_project to check if you understand the goal and the process of the project or not 

When i run app.py , D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\interface\app.py
it is connected to 
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\interface\components\canvas_handler.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\interface\components\ui_components.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\image_processor.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\core\model_manager.py

canvas_handler.py is connected to
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\mask_generator.py


Now model_manager.py is connected to 
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\weight_loader.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\data_loader.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\models\pconv\models\pconv_unet.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\models\pconv\loss.py

data_loader.py is connected to 
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\image_processor.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\utils\mask_generator.py

loss.py is connected to
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\models\pconv\vgg_extractor.py


pconv_unet.py is conected to
D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\models\pconv\layers\partialconv2d.py

DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO CONNECT MORE FILES from the structure of my codebase?
or are these connections enough

and also give me a 2 line summary of the above mentioned file so that i know u have read them 
and tell me if they need any improvements 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHEN ERRROR OCCURS (upload the error , output_of_Seven_tests, structure_of_codebase.txt ,goal_and_context_of_the_project )

When i clicked the process image button it showed me the following error The detailed error is also uploaded in the file above 

Error: 
Cannot hash argument 'self' (of type `__main__.InpaintingApp`) in 'initialize_model'. 
To address this, you can tell Streamlit not to hash this argument by adding a leading underscore to the argument's name in the function signature: 
@st.cache_resource 

        def initialize_model(_self, ...): ... 

I want you to solve the error
Now I want you to know the following things before solving the error 
I feel the following context will help you solve the error much faster and in a efficient way 


Context about the connection of the codebase 
When i run app.py , D:\Inpainting_tool2\src\interface\app.py

All the above mentioned files are uploaded in the knowledge content 
read them carefully 
give me a one line summary of the above files so that I know you have read all the files 
Also tell me if you understand the connections of file 

Context about pretrained weights:
Now the code must use the pre-trained weights saved in the below paths mentioned 
D:\Inpainting_tool2\weights\pconv\unet\model_weights.pth
D:\Inpainting_tool2\weights\pconv\vgg16\pdvgg16_bn_model_best.pth.tar
D:\Inpainting_tool2\weights\pconv\vgg16\vgg16_weights.pth

the above weight D:\Inpainting_tool2\weights\pconv\vgg16\pdvgg16_bn_model_best.pth.tar is downloaded from the README.md file of the following git repository 
https://github.com/NVIDIA/partialconv
From the above git repository i got the following link in its README.md 

### Pretrained checkpoints (weights) for VGG and ResNet networks with partial convolution based padding:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t6flbuoipyzqid8/AACJ8rtrF6V5b9348aG5PIhia?dl=0

the other 2 weights were converted from the below .h5 files 
D:\Inpainting_tool2\temp_weights\pconv_imagenet.h5
D:\Inpainting_tool2\temp_weights\pytorch_to_keras_vgg16.h5

I got the above weights from a different git repository 
https://github.com/MathiasGruber/PConv-Keras

I then converted above .h5 files using the below code file
D:\Inpainting_tool2\scripts\weight_conversion\convert_weights.py
D:\Inpainting_tool2\scripts\weight_conversion\converter.py

I then verified the converted weights using the below code file
D:\Inpainting_tool2\scripts\weight_conversion\verify_weights.py

Output of verified_wieghts.py

The output of the above files is uploaded in D:\Inpainting_tool2\tests\Output_of_seven_tests.txt
Output_of_seven_tests.txt is uploaded in knowledge content 

If you want i can also upload the below files 
test_config.py , test_data_loader.py , test_image_processor.py , test_mask_generator.py , test_model_manager.py , test_pconv.py ,test_weight_loader.py , test_vgg_extractor.py

Also read the structure_of_codebase.txt and goal_and_context_of_the_project for better understanding 

Give me a 4 - 5 line summary of all the texts files ( Output_of_seven_tests.txt , structure_of_codebase.txt,  goal_and_context_of_the_project.txt) 


Context about dataset used:

Read the dataset.txt which is uploaded in the knowledge content 

give me a 2 summary about dataset.txt 

I am asking you to give me all the summary because i want you to understand the context and goal of my project 

and then in the second prompt i will give you the information about problem 

then tell me which files do you need to solve the problem / error 

always remember that whenever i give a problem or error tell me which files do you need to solve the error or problem 

I will give you files and then you must give me the changes required
